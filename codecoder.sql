Learn more\r\nGot it!\r\nPaper CheckerHomeFeaturesPricingHelp / FAQsLog In\r\n\r\n \r\nAfter four years on Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C., the equivalent of Broadway, the Donald Trump Show is on the road, though it attracts younger viewers. According to a recent Gallup poll, 38% approve of his \"performance\" and 59% disapprove, a 19% gap. Even outside of Broadway, at his convention in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for example, there were empty seats, and the overflow area was closed due to limited availability. At the time, the Joe Biden Show (a type of non-show made mostly from his Delaware base) has attracted growing interest. A majority of the recent polls show Biden with an 8-12% greater lead over Trump. Biden also has attracted more investors than Trump, who has achieved excellent presidential financial performance over the past two months and in the last quarter. By those steps, Biden\'s candidate would do well by sitting on his basement. The common understanding is that people are frustrated by the lack of presidential leadership during the coronavirus and the protest issues. The president\'s campaign to take a second term is often a reference to his first four years in office, so that\'s an important point. It is also important that the strong economy that the President plans to re-work on has been removed. I would say differently, though. I would say that disrupting the president, who likes to work more than the administration, may seem tempting to the theory but it\'s very difficult to let go. If you remember the Trump fundraising campaign, it was that someone outside of Washington needed to come and \"hack the swimming pool\" - or disrupt the corrupt system. As Yuval Levin states in his latest book, A Time to Build, Trump is the first president ever to have formed and shaped American institutions such as the military, big corporations, legislature, or governor\'s office. He came into the presidency from a family and well-known businessman, which is why he can. As a celebrity president, Trump is more into tweets and speeches than official accomplishments or policy initiatives. As veteran of the campaign Karl Rove recently pointed out, he will still have to tell the American people what he will do when he is elected to the second term. His presidency is not about agendas and policies but about him - his values and his frustration, supported by his foundation. But it is difficult to treat the government that way, and in the end, that is exactly what we expected the president to do. Afterwards Biden, then, appeared to be able to form a government. His work is composed of the Senate and the president. In the face of the latest challenges, Biden has developed some tips on what to do with the coronavirus challenge, for example. Her communications are more about policies and programs than her complaints and concerns. It looks like you have a desire to govern. Frustration and disruption have their place, but it is difficult to lead an institution from that foundation. Leadership as a profession has long been part of politics, but never has a political leader ever tried to invest so much in those who have shown little interest in policy and governance. It looks like the Trump Show may not be renewed for long. Critics have never liked it, but now, without his strong base, even the audience seems tired of it. Unemployment from an informed electoral base seems appropriate to receive tributes and tweets, interruptions and Trump\'s approval petition. As British Prime Minister Harold Wilson famously said, \"The church has been a long time in politics.\" We\'ll have to keep our eye on the floor and the floor for another couple of months.

If access on the Services to a work that you submitted to BNED is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA copyright infringement notice, and you believe in good faith that the allegedly infringing works have been removed or blocked by mistake or misidentification, then you may send a \"Counter-Notification\" to the email address listed above.

If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification. However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the address above that the party who sent us the DMCA copyright infringement notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Services. Upon our receipt of a Counter-Notification that satisfies the requirements of DMCA, we will provide a copy of the counter notification to the person who sent the original notification of claimed infringement and will follow the DMCA\'s procedures regarding counter notification. All Counter-Notifications must satisfy the requirements of Section 512(g)(3) of the U.S. Copyright Act. In all events, you expressly agree that neither BNED nor any of its affiliates or their employees, officers, directors, or agents will be a party to any disputes or lawsuits regarding alleged copyright infringement.

(3, 'Web developers', 'Must-read developer content', 'Third-Post', 'It\'s very possible that you rely on Apache Lucene and Apache Solr every day, whether you\'re looking for jobs on LinkedIn, trying to find that \"bird-carries-shark\" video on Twitter, or looking up random facts on Wikipedia. It\'s also very possible that you have no clue how Lucene/Solr work, or how they\'re developed. As such, you can be forgiven for not noticing that a few weeks back the Lucene/Solr community voted to break up, breaking Solr out from under Lucene and reversing the merger of the two a decade earlier, which you also likely missed. And yet the designation of Solr as a top-level Apache Software Foundation project matters, and not just for the developers who contribute to one or the other (or both). While disentangling the two projects (build infrastructure, source code, etc.) will take time, users will benefit. Here\'s how. Making life easier for the kingmakers While most people reading this won\'t have any familiarity with Lucene, Solr, or Elasticsearch (a distributed search application that relies on Lucene), we use them every day. Lucene is a full-text search engine library, whereas Solr is a full-text search engine web application built on Lucene. One way to think about Lucene and Solr is as a car and its engine. The engine is Lucene; the car is Solr. A wide array of companies (Ford, Salesforce, etc.) use Solr to provide search on their websites without needing to build an application to make use of the Lucene library. Others want to fiddle more with the dials and knobs of Lucene and don\'t rely on Solr. Regardless, the two projects have been tightly bound since 2010 when the Lucene and Solr project management committees (PMC) voted to merge the two projects because \"there was a lot of code duplication and interaction between Solr and Lucene back then,\" as Dawid Weiss explained. Keeping the two together has become a burden over time. Solr depends on Lucene, but Lucene doesn\'t depend on Solr, and tying Lucene to Solr has, among other things, made it harder to innovate the Lucene code at a pace many of its developers would like. SEE: 5 developer interview horror stories (free PDF) (TechRepublic) The two projects have continued to attract healthy, largely independent development communities, with new feature work happening in one or the other, not both. This divergence isn\'t complete, of course. As Mike Sokolov noted, \"A substantial number of people commit to both, over time, although most people do not. Also, relatively few commits span both projects. Some do though, and it\'s certainly worth considering what the workflow for such changes would be like in the split world.\" Even so, forcing them to join at the hip, though it once made sense as a way to retire some technical debt, no longer makes sense. None of which would matter to the average user of LinkedIn, except that this separation promises to improve developer productivity for Lucene and Solr. If developers are the new kingmakers, as analyst firm Redmonk is wont to say, then making developers as productive as possible matters a great deal. So how does this split promise to help developers? First, the split will make development for the respective projects more nimble. According to Weiss: Precommit/ test times. These are crazy high. If we split into two projects we can pretty much cut all of Lucene testing out of Solr (and likewise), making development a bit more fun again. Build system itself and source release packaging. The current combined codebase is a *beast* to maintain. Working with gradle on both projects at once made me realise how little the two have in common. The code layout, the dependencies, even the workflow of people working on these projects... The build (both ant and gradle) is full of Solr and Lucene-specific exceptions and hooks that could be more elegantly solved if moved to each project independently. Second, separating the two allows their respective developers to focus on making Lucene (or Solr) as great as possible; so, a developer who makes API changes to Lucene will no longer need to make corresponding changes to Solr. This, in turn, allows both projects to release according to feature readiness, rather than waiting on each other. Given that Lucene tends to move at a fast pace of feature development, it means faster releases and improvements to the search services users depend upon. This split won\'t make the front page of The New York Times, unfortunately. However, those searching for articles in the Times will benefit. Because, of course, the Times relies on Lucene-powered Elasticsearch for that search functionality. Disclosure: I work at AWS, but this article reflects my views, not those of my employer.

(4, ' The Future Of Language Learning', ' And Why It’s Important To Try', 'forth Post', 'Learning a new language is difficult and time-consuming. Yet, once one does so, one\'s ability to appreciate and experience a culture is fundamentally augmented. Whether someone heads to Ibiza for vacation or conducts business in Beijing, being able to speak the native language enhances one\'s interactions. Benjamin Dent, 30, and Joon Beh, 29, are two entrepreneurs who have built a platform and community called Hallo to democratize English language learning. \r\n\r\nHallo cofounders Benjamin Dent (left) and Joon Beh (right).\r\n\r\nBenjamin Dent\r\nDent recollects, \"During my birth, my mom experienced complications that left me blind in my left eye. However, my parents didn\'t know until my kindergarten teacher expressed concern when he watched me struggle to find a crayon I dropped. For the next nine years, I wore glasses with a patch covering my strong eye to strengthen my damaged eye, eventually switching to a less conspicuous black contact lens. It was a bumpy and lonely road. From being called 4 eyes to running into walls, this experience endowed me with a new kind of vision: to dream and to create.\"\r\n\r\nHis vision manifested Hallo.\r\n\r\nIt\'s helpful to understand the following question to appreciate Hallo\'s goal fully.\r\n\r\nWhat is language?\r\n\r\nSome assert language to be humans\' ability to communicate the actual appearance of the world. Others posit language as our attempt to produce concepts that incorporate and reinforce our individual and collective experience within the world. The philosophical debate continues. Yet, one must also consider how humans use language in practice. There is no better example than the Rosetta Stone.\r\n\r\nThe Rosetta Stone on display in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nBritish Museum\r\nDiscovered on July 15th, 1799 by French troops during Napoleon\'s military campaign of Egypt, the stele, or stone slab, was a watershed moment for European historians studying Ancient Egyptian civilization. Inscriptions etched into its surface in three different texts: hieroglyphics, Demotic, and Ancient Greek. The critical insight is the three distinct Stone\'s etchings reflect the same proclamation. At the time of its discovery, no one could decipher hieroglyphics, but they could read Ancient Greek. Thus, an English physicist named Thomas Young used the Ancient Greek text to translate the hieroglyphics section of the Stone. The Stone\'s purpose was to record King Ptolemy V\'s decree as the divine ruler of Egypt during the 2nd century B.C. The proclamation\'s detailing in three different languages was a consequence of communicating his order to different classes of the population: hieroglyphics for the priests, whose favor Ptolemy wished to gain and secure as he ruled; Demotic (the common language) for the hoi polloi he governed over; and Ancient Greek for his administrators to reinforce the spirit of the text as he reigned. From the Rosetta Stone\'s existence and function, one can offer up an answer to the question of the nature of language.\r\n\r\nMen ceaselessly try to understand Man physically, mentally, and emotionally as he lived in a particular time and place. Language is Man\'s temporal and spatial expression of himself and his relation to others and his environment.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to examining only Ptolemaic Egypt, humanity\'s capacity for travel necessitates the need for language to help comprehend a global world and its myriad civilizations. The barriers between cultures continue to break down as our world becomes more interconnected politically, economically, and socially. However, language has proven to be both an obstacle and a conduit towards integrating oneself among a foreign nation. Dent and Beh saw the chasm between these linguistic worlds and built a bridge called Hallo to connect them. Hallo bills itself as the \"future of language learning,\" allowing native English speakers to teach users through the startup\'s smartphone app. Founded in April 2017, the Provo, Utah-based company has recently raised a $1.4 million seed from Kickstart as the lead investor, with participation from RevRoad and Tamarak.\r\n\r\nDalton Wright, a investment partner at Kickstart, says, “We invested in Hallo to create a space for language learners and teachers around the world to easily connect, form virtual communities and engage in authentic interactions that accelerate the acquisition of language and cultural fluency, all while making new friends and contacts in regions in which users hope to travel, immigrate, do business and pursue their dreams.”\r\n\r\nDent and Beh presenting Hallo on stage.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Dent.\r\nThe American Dream served as the fuel for the immigrant\'s imagination in fashioning a better life for themselves abroad then and now. Dent\'s ancestors heard America\'s promise and responded by undertaking the Atlantic voyage towards an uncertain, hopeful future. Deanna, Ben\'s mother, retells their family\'s American presence rooted in their Italian heritage.\r\n\r\nShe says, \"Ben\'s maternal great grandfather, Giovanni Giuseppe Lazzareschi, was born in Camigliano, Italy. He came to America and enlisted immediately in the U.S. Army about 1915. Joining the Army is one way to gain citizenship quicker. He was stationed in France and Germany [during World War I]. He fought alongside his cousin Julius Pacini (from Lucca, Italy) and even saved his life. He received the Purple Heart and other medals (so did Julius). He learned a lot of English during his time in the Army. Once in America proper after the war, he sent for Ben\'s great grandmother, Maria Clementina Clotilde Lazzareschi (née Manni), who was born in Lucca, Italy, to come to America, so they could get married. They were very proud to be in America and received their naturalization, so back then, they had to have excellent English skills to pass that test.\"\r\n\r\nDent\'s great grandparents\' American pride was found in Beh\'s family as well, for the latter immigrated several decades later to the U.S. Beh states, \"My parents were born and raised in South Korea. The first time my dad saw native speakers was at Yonsei University, which is in the top three universities in Korea. He was walking around the campus one day and ran into two Americans that were Mormon missionaries in Seoul at that time. They started hanging out together, and my dad started enjoying learning about different cultures. He ended up studying at [the University of] Cambridge, where he learned his cool British accent. Later on in 2007, my family decided to move to Utah in the USA, and that\'s how my American Dream started.\"\r\n\r\nIn both families\' cases, their ability to learn English was critical to their successful assimilation into American life. The need to adopt the mother tongue of their new country is a timeless challenge for any immigrant. Despite the lack of formal classes and curricula, the Dent and Beh families were able to find their way in a land far, far away from their own. Although they were able to learn English, many immigrants and travelers are not. In America\'s current political climate, the country has scaled backcountry\'s immigrant-friendly rhetoric and aspirations. The Trump administration has recently suspended the issuing of H1-B visas, which U.S. corporations used to hire highly talented immigrants to work legally. (It certainly does not help matters given the European Union has barred U.S. citizens from traveling to Europe given the the coronavirus surging in America.) While the flame attracting the brightest from around the world to the U.S. has temporarily dimmed, the need for a better way to become fluent in English still burns brightly.\r\n\r\nBeh says, \"Because of my immigrant background, I\'ve experienced and lived through the problem that Hallo is trying to solve for many years. When my family moved to the United States from Korea 13 years ago, I realized what it takes to become fluent and speak like a native speaker. Language learners spend most of their time in textbooks, but the most effective way to learn is by practicing and speaking with real people 24/7. As I listened to Uber\'s engineers as a Deloitte consultant in San Francisco, something clicked in my head. ‘Uber for language learning!’ It would be amazing if I could speak and practice with a native speaker via video at the click of a button.\" For the next couple of weeks, I couldn\'t help but keep thinking about the idea. I started telling my family and friends, and most importantly, I was so excited that I made up my mind to pursue my dream.\"\r\n\r\nDongChol, Joon\'s father, confirms this: \"Joon is a boy who does what he wants to do. When he was young, he asked his mom to buy his favorite toy. My wife asked me to buy it for him, but I thought the toy was not worth it, so I didn\'t. Anyway, he started asking all day long, day and night, the next day, and so on. How focused he was. I couldn\'t stand it anymore, so I ended up buying it for him. From this experience, I realized Joon does whatever he sets up his mind to no matter what. He would do whatever he wants to do.\"\r\n\r\nThere are several problems as one takes a closer look at the challenge of learning a new language. Most English language lessons fail to include the opportunity to practice speaking in an authentic conversation. The standard exercises used in these training fail to approximate any real-world situation when communicating with another in the same language. The cost of such lessons is also a significant barrier. For well-rated programs, their prices run into the hundreds and thousands of dollars. English language studies teaching has stagnated for decades. There is an endless number of academies training pupils a new language in tired, static ways. The most critical problem is the lack of community while learning different languages. Language isn\'t solely expressed by yourself, but with others in dialogue. Community reinforces your learning of a new language in ways that individual lessons struggle to recreate. The unsolved problems associated with learning a foreign language reveal a lucrative market in addressing students\' unmet needs.\r\n\r\nDent adds, \"When Joon shared the idea of Hallo, \'Uber for language learning,\' I instantly saw the vision. At that time, I worked on a side hustle focused on building community within mental health. I connected the two ideas and boom - it clicked! Both of us had experienced the ups and downs of learning a new language and living in other countries. The passion and vision we both shared as we mapped out Hallo on a whiteboard in room W210 on BYU\'s campus were tangible.\"\r\n\r\nJoon (left) and Ben (right) on stage at the Silicon Slopes Technology Summit 2020.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Dent\r\nTechCrunch reports there is a \"$60 billion global language learning market\" up for grabs. According to the Harvard Business Review, English is the \"global language of business.\" Given the international scale of business, it is no surprise that efforts to learn English generate the majority of the overall revenue. Adroit Market Research estimates, \"the global English language learning market value was around $33.5 billion in 2018.\" The projected value of the online learning sub-sector of the overall market is $17 billion by 2027. Duolingo, VIPKid, Babbel, Rosetta Stone, and others are competitors in the market. Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, and Babbel offer multiple languages to study via structured modules and lessons, while Hallo and VIPKid only offers English to learn. VIPKid focuses on native English speakers teaching Chinese students, in contrast to Hallo ostensively cultivating a more diverse user base. Nevertheless, Hallo aims to find a way to stand out among the competition to teach users how to learn English.\r\n\r\nHallo\'s smartphone application.\r\n\r\nJoon Beh\r\nHallo has built a live-streaming learning platform for non-native speakers. Native English speakers host live streams via their startup\'s smartphone app to teach English and allow learners to experience cultural immersion from all parts of the world. These live streams consist of multiple users listening to a native English teacher at once. The community that forms from users engaging with one another while learning from a teacher generates more opportunity to practice. Such a digital gathering serves as a retention tool to keep users on the platform. If they make a friend while learning English on Hallo, they will be more likely to continue using Hallo by practicing with others to master their command of the English language. These Hallo communities also function as customer acquisition channels via word-of-mouth. The better experience users have on the platform with their fellow learners or teacher, the more likely they will tell peers who are not using Hallo to download it. The virtuous cycle repeats to create a powerful network effect. Hallo\'s network effect emanates from three underlying factors: the proliferation of smartphone technology, the rapid growth of the passion economy, and the emergence of Utah\'s startup ecosystem, Silicon Slopes.\r\n\r\nDent says, \"The timing couldn\'t be better for Hallo. A lot of our users are coming from outside of the United States in areas like South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Our plan is to dominate in the English market where there is a big opportunity. We focused first on English. It is such a valuable language to learn. It’s essentially currency and in someways a degree/passport to new opportunities. Then, our plan is expand into other languages. Also, there couldn\'t be a better time and opportunity to democratize language learning through technology. One of our initiatives, The Language Summit, aims to bring language learning community together and innovate as the future is shaped through modern day technology. In the words of our fans, Hallo is \"uniting people under one roof\" through language.\"\r\n\r\nBen and Joon at a Silicon Slopes tech conference in Utah.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Dent\r\nBeh adds, \"Utah\'s startup scene has been in the news lately, and the state of Utah has done a lot in recent years to position itself as one of the main hubs for tech companies in the United States, if not the world. We are getting tremendous support from fellow entrepreneurs and startup communities in Utah, and we are proud to be part of Silicon Slopes.\"\r\n\r\nHallo claims that they have been able to 50x their growth without spending any additional capital on marketing. The cofounders also state that they have over 700,000 registered users, with an average of 15,000 new students signing up per week and daily user engagement of roughly thirty-five minutes. The startup\'s strong user growth with minimized spending reflects a sound, capital-efficient business model. Hallo has three key revenue streams: live streams ($5/mo), private lessons ($14/mo), and premium features ($5/mo). The startup claims its competitively- priced three-pronged strategy has resulted in a 50% month-over-month revenue growth. Hallo\'s product offerings differentiate them from their competition while allowing for durable unit economics. Dent\'s and Beh\'s respective talents combine to build upon Hallo\'s successes so far.\r\n\r\nThe Hallo Team.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Dent\r\nDent\'s and Beh\'s blended, unique skillset give Hallo a chance at being the de facto language English learning platform for non-native speakers. Both cofounders graduated from Brigham Young University. Dent and Beh earned their undergraduate degrees in Psychology and Accounting, respectively.

(6, 'College football\'s fate', 'ready to fight ', 'Fivth-Post', 'It’s not a reckless thing to say, although some health experts might suggest it is until a vaccine arrives. But if this is a hellacious fight against COVID-19, go ahead and fight it. Fight it on all fronts, in the factories and food stores, in hospitals and hair salons, essential and non-essential, although every job is essential to someone. And yes, fight it in the sports world, with no sport facing a bigger battle than football. Some will say it’s foolish to even try. Cancel the season. Shorten the season. Push it to the spring. Play with no fans or limited fans.\r\n\r\nThose are possible outcomes and most coaches don’t deny it. And frankly, if we as a nation can’t alter our behaviors enough to get the virus under control, we don’t deserve sports, or concerts, or large indoor gatherings. I suppose it depends on how badly you want it, and when it comes to football, Harbaugh is relentless in his advocacy.\r\n\r\n“I share the same opinion as our players — they want to play,” he said. “They’ve been training their whole lives for these opportunities. Put the question to them, which I have, and they would rather play than not play. And they’d rather play in front of no fans than not play.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, the necessary caution: “Now if it comes to a point in time where you say, we can’t play, it’s obvious, it’s clear, everybody would be reasonable and know that was the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nUntil — or if — it comes to that point, there’s no harm in trying to avoid it, no matter how dire it seems. Power 5 conference commissioners have said they hope to have a decision on the season by the end of July, and the PAC-12’s Larry Scott recently said it was “a lot more perilous than a few weeks ago.” The Ivy League just announced it was pushing football to the spring, which is ominous but won’t necessarily affect other conferences.\r\n\r\nMore: \'They want to play\': Jim Harbaugh hopes COVID won\'t sideline college football this fall\r\n\r\nMore: Ivy League scraps sports competition for first semester\r\n\r\nMore: \'Heartbreaking day\': Stanford drops 11 sports to cut costs\r\n\r\nMichigan’s training camp workouts are scheduled to start July 24, and of approximately 530 athletes in all sports who have reported to Ann Arbor, two have tested positive. Yet elsewhere, dozens of football players have tested positive at places such as Clemson, LSU, Texas and Kansas State. Several Power 5 programs have halted workouts, and Ohio State and North Carolina just joined the group. The quick conclusion is, certain measures work, and stricter measures provide better chances.\r\n\r\nMichigan’s safety protocols, similar to Michigan State’s, involve rampant testing, constant temperature checks, separate housing for quarantining if needed, and facemasks at all times except during workouts. Fittingly, the sport that requires facemasks on the field needs them off the field more than any other.\r\n\r\n“COVID is part of our society, it wasn’t caused by football or caused by sports, and no expert view that I’m aware of says that sports is going to make that worse,” Harbaugh said. “We’re gonna have to deal with it. These kids are gonna have to do the same thing. … I would want the responsibility of keeping our players safe, and also educating them. I wouldn’t want to come off that guard tower.”\r\n\r\nHarbaugh’s first point isn’t entirely correct, because we don’t know yet whether sports will make it worse. The larger point is, while scientists hunt for important clues, personal and institutional responsibility are paramount. Why should Michigan, or any school, abdicate its goal of keeping student-athletes (and all students) safe by sending them away? Outside of structured environments, infections have spread. College football athletic complexes may be as structured as anywhere.\r\n\r\nAutoplay\r\n\r\nShow Thumbnails\r\n\r\nShow Captions\r\n\r\nLast SlideNext Slide\r\nIn the quest for no-risk settings (impossible), society must settle for reduced-risk settings. It’s the case in auto plants and grocery stores, on airplanes and buses. It will be the much-debated case as elementary and high schools try to open. Everyone has to find a way to deal with it, although no one should be bull-headed. If a season starts and the virus spreads, you halt the attempt and prepare for another time.\r\n\r\n “It’s a different conversation if no students are on campus,” Harbaugh said. “If students are on campus, my personal belief, as a parent of a daughter who’d also be on campus, this is a safe place, as safe as possible within our university.”\r\n\r\nHarbaugh rarely lacks enthusiasm about his team, and after four months of communicating with players and coaches through Zoom calls, his excitement is bubbling. He praised the conditioning of several players, especially on an offensive line that lost four starters but returns All-American candidate Jalen Mayfield.\r\n\r\nHe singled out freshman safety RJ Moten and defensive lineman Donovan Jeter as examples of players who added strength and size. When he went down the list of players showing notable leadership, he mentioned all three quarterbacks, Dylan McCaffrey, Joe Milton and Cade McNamara.\r\n\r\nThe Wolverines were 9-4 and haven’t won the Big Ten or beaten Ohio State in his five seasons, but Harbaugh’s 35-minute conference call had a pep-talk feel to it.\r\n\r\n“It’s been a tremendous offseason, even before it got interrupted you could really see the talent and work ethic,” Harbaugh said. “I’d say the biggest question I’m getting from our players is, how they can be a part of the solution? The feedback has been that their peers, other people in their age group, are somewhat cavalier about the virus. They want to be a force for good. For example, when they’re here, they’ve been terrific about following protocols. They’ve taken it to the extra level, from wearing a mask in public, to socially distancing, to cooking their own food.”\r\n\r\nThe fight for football is taking place far from the practice fields, and it’s a worthy battle. Beyond the enormous economic impact — Stanford just announced it was cutting 11 varsity sports, a growing trend — there is a societal impact. In the process of attempting to further their own careers, players can show how it might work, while fully understanding the consequences.\r\n\r\nOklahoma coach Lincoln Riley said a spring season is “very doable” and every option should be explored. Harbaugh said he’d welcome football in any scenario — in the spring, no non-conference games, a 10-game Big Ten slate, a delayed start.\r\n\r\nIt’s not just about trying to prove he can push Michigan to the level that was expected when he arrived. It’s about navigating a treacherous path, because if college football truly starts on time and Michigan plays that opener at Washington Sept. 5, something remarkable was accomplished.\r\n\r\nHarbaugh and the Wolverines face the standard fights — try to compete with the Buckeyes, try to finally win the Big Ten, try to beat ranked teams on the road. Daunting indeed. But in these unsettling, unprecedented times, just getting on the field will be everyone’s biggest battle.', 'footbool.jpg', '2020-07-09 15:50:35');

(7, 'Direct and indirect punishment of norm violations in daily life', 'Life', 'Six-Post', 'Materials, data, and code\r\nMethods and materials for the study were pre-registered and are available on the Open Science Framework (OSF; registration DOI [https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FDZXT]). The data and syntax that are relevant to the analyses described herein are also publicly available53, DOI [https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DU7MP].\r\n\r\nSample and data collection\r\nWe used two Dutch panel agencies (Flycatcher and Link2Trials) to recruit 257 participants for a study with three parts: (a) an intake that took place in the laboratory of the VU Amsterdam; (b) a daily assessment phase, during which participants received daily surveys on their mobile phones for a 2-week period; and (c) a follow-up phase, in which participants were asked additional questions about events reported in the daily assessments, 7–14 days after they occurred. Among the 256 participants who provided demographic information, 66.1% identified as female (one participant chose the “other” option). The sample was diverse in terms of age (M = 39.15 years, SD = 16.02, range: 18–75 years) and was highly educated (60.5% had a bachelor’s or higher degree; 39.5% had secondary education, including vocational training). The average subjective socioeconomic status (measured via a 1 to 10-point ladder method) was above the scale midpoint (M = 6.49, SD = 1.54). Most participants (90.2%) were born in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThis research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the VU Amsterdam (#VCWE-2018–052). All participants provided informed consent.\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\nParticipants signed up via an online survey, which provided information about the study and the inclusion criteria (age ≥18, fluency in Dutch, owning a smartphone with internet access). They provided their contact details and indicated three time slots when they would be available to participate in the study. Then, they were contacted via email to schedule the intake.\r\n\r\nIntake\r\nIntake sessions took place in the laboratory of the VU Amsterdam in June and July 2018; sessions were conducted by the first author. Upon arrival, participants were led to closed cubicles and were asked to read and sign informed consent forms. In a fixed sequence, they completed: (a) questionnaires measuring individual differences (in randomized order), (b) demographic questions, (c) measures of physical formidability, and (d) incentivized, decision-making tasks (in randomized order). All questions and tasks were implemented in Qualtrics. Finally, participants received standardized, video-recorded instructions for the daily assessment phase (the transcript is available on the OSF; [https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FDZXT]) and had the opportunity to ask clarification questions. On average, the intake took one hour to complete.\r\n\r\nDaily assessment phase\r\nDaily surveys were implemented in Qualtrics and sent to participants’ mobile phones via SurveySignal54. The daily assessment phase started on the day after the intake and lasted for 2 weeks. On each day, at 19:00, participants received a text message with a link to the daily survey. If they did not complete the survey within an hour, they received a reminder. Each survey remained open for six hours. The median time until opening the link was one hour and one minute, and the median time of survey completion was 7 min.\r\n\r\nIn each daily survey, participants were first asked (a) whether they were personally affected by a behavior that they thought was wrong (Branch 1: self-relevant event) and then (b) whether they witnessed or learned about someone else being affected by a behavior that they thought was wrong (Branch 2: other-relevant event). Thus, in each daily survey, participants could report on a maximum of two violations: one victimizing themselves and one victimizing someone else. If participants responded “Yes” to both questions, they completed the respective questionnaires and were then sent to the end of the survey. If they responded “No” to one of these questions, they were then asked to (c) think about and report on the last situation that they experienced with another person (Branch 3: social event). Finally, if they responded “No” to both initial prompts, they were also asked to (d) think about and report on the last situation that they experienced alone (Branch 4: non-social event). Thus, participants reported on one out of four possible combinations of events: (1) self-relevant event & other-relevant event; (2) self-relevant event & social event; (3) other-relevant event & social event; (4) social event & non-social event.\r\n\r\nThe overall response rate was 80.27%. In total, participants completed 2888 daily surveys. In 1236 cases (42.80%), participants reported experiencing at least one violation. Given that it was possible to report on two violations in the same daily survey, the total number of reported violations was higher: k = 1,468 (self-relevant: k = 901; other-relevant: k = 567).\r\n\r\nFollow-up phase\r\nFollow-up surveys were also implemented in Qualtrics and sent to participants’ phones via text messages. In the follow-ups, participants read the descriptions of norm violations that they had provided in the daily assessment phase, and they answered additional questions about their consecutive responses to those violations. We sent the first follow-up one day after the end of the daily assessment phase; there, participants answered questions about events from the first week of the daily assessment phase. We sent the second follow-up survey 1 week after the end of the daily assessment phase; there, participants answered questions about events from the second week of the daily assessment phase. Thus, there was a time-lag of between 7 and 14 days between daily surveys and follow-up surveys. As with the daily assessments, we sent participants a reminder if they did not respond to the follow-ups within an hour. Each follow-up survey remained open for 24 h.\r\n\r\nThe response rate for the first follow-up was 71.98%; the response rate for the second follow-up (40.02%) was lower. Due to a technical problem with the software used to automatically send surveys, 55 participants did not receive the second follow-up. When considering only participants who received the survey, the response rate for the second follow-up (62.38%) was higher. The median time until opening follow-up survey links was one hour and 20 min, and the median time of survey completion was six minutes.\r\n\r\nParticipant compensation\r\nParticipants received €20 for the intake, which included €5 for transportation costs. During the incentivized decision-making tasks in the intake, they could earn a bonus of up to €5. For each completed survey in the daily assessment phase, they received €1. Additionally, they could earn a bonus of €10 for completing at least 80% of the daily assessments. Finally, completion of each follow-up survey was incentivized with €5. In total, participants could therefore earn 20 (intake) + 5 (intake bonus) + 14 (daily assessments) + 10 (daily assessments bonus) + 10 (follow-ups) = €59. On average, participants received €49.35.\r\n\r\nMeasures\r\nA list of all measures and materials is available on the OSF pre-registration page for the study: https://osf.io/fdzxt. In what follows, we describe in detail only measures and materials that are relevant to the present investigation.\r\n\r\nIntake\r\nAt the end of the intake, participants received detailed, video-recorded instructions for the daily assessment phase (the full transcript is available on the OSF).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we told participants that, in each daily survey, we would ask them about two types of events, both of which concern another person’s behavior that they thought was wrong. We specifically instructed them to think about behaviors that they witnessed on the day of the assessment and that they thought were immoral, unacceptable, or improper37,38. We described these behaviors as going against their values or principles55, and as potentially leading to disapproval and punishment from themselves or others11.\r\n\r\nWe told participants that, in each daily survey, we would first ask them about events in which another person’s wrong behavior personally affected them, and we provided examples of such behaviors (e.g., a friend lying, an acquaintance saying something offensive). We then told them that we would separately ask about events in which they witnessed or learned about another person’s wrong behavior that affected someone else. Again, we provided various examples of such behaviors (e.g., witnessing a fight on the street, hearing something bad about their boss). Participants were instructed to think of situations in which they were physically present, but also about behaviors that they learnt about from another source. We mentioned that the offender could be someone they knew or a stranger, and that the violation could be serious or mundane. If on a given day they encountered more than one violation, we asked them to report on the one they found most important.\r\n\r\nParticipants were then shown screenshot examples of questions from the different parts of the survey (e.g., concerning their relationship with the offender and the victim, their emotions). Given our focus on punishment responses, we gave more detailed instructions regarding items measuring motivations to engage in various types of punishment and punishment behaviors. Specifically, we told participants that we would ask them questions about how they felt like reacting to the offender’s behavior and gave them examples of items measuring motivations to engage in punishment. Then, we told participants that we would ask them how they actually reacted to the offender’s behavior. Here, we used examples to illustrate direct versus indirect punishment and emphasized their distinction based on whether they are overt (i.e., happened in the presence of the offender) or covert (i.e., happened in the absence of the offender). Specifically, for direct confrontation, we instructed participants to think of any behavior they did in the presence of the offender and in response to the wrong behavior (“Did you do something to confront the offender, such as physically stopping this person or arguing with him/her? Here, you can think of any behavior you did in the presence of the offender and in response to the wrong behavior.”). For gossip, we instructed them to think of any information they shared with others in the absence of the offender and in response to the wrong behavior (“Did you tell someone else about the behavior of the offender? Here, you can think of any information you shared with others in the absence of the offender and in response to the wrong behavior.”). We informed them that we would also ask whether they avoided social contact with the offender.\r\n\r\nParticipants also received brief information about the other branches of the daily surveys (Branches 3 and 4: social and non-social events). Finally, they learnt about the details of the compensation scheme, including the bonus for completing more than 80% of daily surveys, and had the opportunity to ask clarification questions.\r\n\r\nDaily assessment phase\r\nWhen participants indicated that they experienced a norm violation—either self- or other-relevant—we asked them to give a brief description of what had happened and to include information about the offender in their description. Examples of described violations are provided in the Supplementary Methods. We also asked participants to indicate whether they were physically present (k = 968) or not (k = 500) when the violation occurred. For a research question that is unrelated to the current investigation, we further measured the number of bystanders present in norm violations.\r\n\r\nWe then asked additional questions regarding the offender. We measured the type of relationship participants had with the offender (family member, romantic partner, friend, classmate or co-worker, instructor or supervisor, acquaintance, stranger, or other) and the gender of the offender (man, woman, other, I don’t know). We also measured the emotional closeness (i.e., “At this moment, I feel close to the offender”) and valuation of participants’ relationship with the offender. To assess the latter, we used a measure of welfare tradeoff ratio (WTRown29,43) toward the offender. Specifically, we asked participants to indicate what would be the highest amount of money (€0–10) they would forego for the offender to receive €10. We used the same method to assess participants’ perceptions of the offender’s welfare tradeoff ratio (WTRother) toward them.\r\n\r\nFurther, we used two questions to assess the moral wrongness (1 = not at all morally wrong, 5 = extremely morally wrong) and harmfulness (1 = not at all harmful, 5 = extremely harmful) of the offender’s behavior. Including both questions allowed us to explore the overlap between judgments of moral wrongness and harm in response to violations56,57. We also measured perceived interdependence with the offender, using three items from the Situational Interdependence Scale58,59. Situational power was measured with one item (“Who had the most influence on what happened in that situation?”; 1 = definitely the offender, 5 = definitely myself).\r\n\r\nOnly when participants indicated that they experienced an other-relevant norm violation, we asked them questions about the victim. Specifically, we measured the type of relationship they had with the victim and we asked for the victim’s gender. We also assessed the emotional closeness of participants’ relationship with the victim (i.e., “At this moment, I feel close to the victim”), their WTRown toward the victim and their perceptions of the victim’s WTRother toward them. Finally, we measured participants’ perceived interdependence with the victim, using items from the Situational Interdependence Scale58,59.\r\n\r\nTo measure emotions, we used arrays of facial emotional expressions from the Radboud Faces Database31,60 and asked participants to indicate whether these faces matched their feelings toward the offender (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree). In this way, we measured five emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and happiness). We also used one item to assess the general valence of participants’ emotional experience (1 = very negative, 5 = very positive).\r\n\r\nFinally, we measured participants’ motivations to engage in various types of punishment and their punishment behaviors. To measure motivations to engage in punishment, we adapted four items from previous work31 assessing tendencies to physically (“I felt like physically intervening to stop the offender”) or verbally (“I felt like yelling at or arguing with the offender”) confront the offender, and to negatively gossip about (“I felt like sharing negative information about the offender to others”) or socially exclude (“I felt like excluding the offender from my social interactions in the future”) the offender. These items were rated on 5-point Likert scales (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree). To measure punishment behaviors, we asked participants to indicate their agreement (binary scale: Yes or No) with three statements about how they actually reacted to the offender’s behavior. We measured (1) direct confrontation (“I confronted the offender about his/her behavior.”), (2) gossip (“I told someone else about this behavior when the offender was absent.”), and (3) social avoidance (“I avoided social contact with the offender.”). Finally, we included an open-ended question where participants could describe in detail how they behaved in response to the violation.\r\n\r\nFollow-up phase\r\nIn the follow-up phase, we presented participants with each of the descriptions of norm violations that they had reported in the 2 weeks of the daily assessment phase. We instructed them to read these descriptions (and some additional information they had provided about the offender, i.e., their relationship type and the offender’s gender) and to answer additional questions about them. Specifically, we used the follow-up surveys to re-assess participants’ feelings of emotional closeness with the offender, their WTRown toward the offender, and their perceptions of the offender’s WTRother toward them. We also assessed emotional responses to violations with the same five arrays of emotional expressions that we used in the daily assessment phase, and the additional item measuring general emotional state.\r\n\r\nThen, we presented participants with the descriptions they gave about their behavioral responses to each of the violations from the daily assessment phase. We instructed them to answer questions concerning what they did on the days after the violation. Then, we assessed punishment behaviors (i.e., direct confrontation, gossip, and social avoidance) with the same three items used in the daily assessment phase. We again included an open-ended question where participants could describe in detail how they behaved on the days after the violation.\r\n\r\nStatistical analyses\r\nData manipulation and data analyses were performed in R and in SPSS.\r\n\r\nData exclusion procedures\r\nWe did not exclude any participants from the analyses, but we only analyzed data from completed daily assessments and follow-up surveys. In some cases, due to technical reasons, participants were able to complete the same daily assessment or follow-up survey more than once. When they did so, we retained the first response. This was either the most complete response or, in few cases, one of multiple incomplete responses.\r\n\r\nData analyses procedures\r\nAll reported statistical tests are two-sided. In all analyses, we used models that account for the hierarchical structure of our data (i.e., reports of violations nested within days, nested within subjects). When predicting punishment motivations (continuous DVs, rated on 5-point Likert scales), we used linear mixed models (run via MIXED in SPSS) with random intercepts and slopes for days and subjects. When predicting punishment behaviors (binary DVs), we used binary logistic regression models (run via Generalized Estimating Equations in SPSS), again nesting observations within days and subjects. In both types of models—MIXED and GEEs—we specified an autocorrelation matrix, to account for the fact that measures taken closer in time can be more correlated than measures taken further in time.', 'life.jpg', '2020-07-09 15:51:03'),
